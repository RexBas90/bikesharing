# bikesharing

## Overview
For this project, data from the Citi Bike program in New York City was used and analyzed to see if a bike share program will be feasible in Des Moines, Iowa. Knowing fully well that Des Moines is not the same as NYC (large population differences and  difference in accessibility), careful thought and analysis was preformed to only ensure that useful data should be used to make inferences about the potential success of a bike share program in Des Moines. Visualizations were created and put in Tableau dashboards and stories to build an argument to investors as to why they should invest in a bikeshare program in Des Moines.

## Summary

Overall, 
Since the only transferrable data is in regards to age, gender, and bike usage time, there is a large gap in assessing the accesibility of the bikes. In NYC, are the bikes primarily used in locations where there are no subway stations? If the bikes are primarily used where there is limited public transporation, that might explain the bike usage in that area. However, if the bike usage is higher around public transit stations, then the opposite may be true where customers/subscribers are using the bikes 

Since NY has more tourism than Des Moines, more visualizations should be created to see how the behavior of subscribers versus customer choose to use the bikeshare. It is recommended to visualize the checkout times by the user type as well as
